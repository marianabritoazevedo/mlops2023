<!-- # Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

ðŸ“š This repository aims to showcase all the work developed in the Machine Learning-Based Systems Projects course (DCA0305) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. In this course, we aim to present various projects ranging from best coding practices to complete MLOps projects involving Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms.

ðŸ¤– MLOps is an approach that seeks to unify the development, training, and deployment of machine learning (ML) models into a continuous and automated process. It is a practice that combines DevOps principles and tools with the specific challenges of the ML lifecycle, as well as involving web development practices, as depicted in the figure below.

Below, you'll find all the projects developed in this course. Feel free to explore!

## Python Essentials for MLOps

This project aims to explore best programming practices in three distinct projects from the Dataquest.io platform. We focus on applying code refactoring techniques, clean code principles, exception handling, and more.

# Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)  

Welcome to the repository for the Machine Learning-Based Systems Projects course (DCA0305) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte! Here, I showcase the projects I developed during this course, ranging from fundamental coding practices to comprehensive MLOps projects involving cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms.

## ðŸ¤– What is MLOps?
MLOps is an innovative approach that harmonizes the development, training, and deployment of machine learning (ML) models into a continuous and automated process. It integrates DevOps principles and tools with the unique challenges of the ML lifecycle, incorporating web development practices. This synergy streamlines the entire ML journey, ensuring efficiency and reliability. Check out the visualization below to get a glimpse of this seamless integration:
