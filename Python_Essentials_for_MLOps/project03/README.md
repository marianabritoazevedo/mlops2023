# Project 03 - Predicting Heart Disease with Supervised Machine Learning ü©∫‚ù§Ô∏èü§ñ

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this Project

The project 03 is about to build a KNN classifier to predict heart diseases. This guided project, avaiable on the [Dataquest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/) platform, focuses on analyzing a dataset containing various features related to numerous patients, such as cholesterol levels, age, and ECG readings. The project encompasses a comprehensive data pipeline, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, data cleaning, feature selection, classifier construction, and result prediction

## üöÄ How to Run this Project

1. **Running `project1.py`**

    - First, create a virtual environment on your computer:

        ```bash
        python -m venv your_env
        ```

    - In the directory `project03`, there is the `requirements.txt` file. Install the required libraries:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    - Execute the code by running the following command:

        ```bash
        python project3.py
        ```

    - To assess the code quality using `pylint`, run the following command:

        ```bash
        pylint project3.py
        ```

    - For unit testing, use the following command:

        ```bash
        pytest project3.py
        ```

3. **Running `project3_notebook.ipynb`**

    - Open the Jupyter notebook, `project3_notebook.ipynb`, on your local machine or in a tool like Google Colaboratory.

    - Run all the notebook cells to perform necessary installations and interact with the code.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note about pylint

In this project, after running  `pylint`, the obtained score was 9.69 out of 10.00. This occurred due to three main reasons:

- Variables `X` and `y` don't adhere to the snake_case naming style: as these variables are standard in the data science community, the decision was made to retain these names;

- To many local variables in `main()` function: given the complexity of the analysis being performed, and with no repeated variables within this function, it was decided to keep it as is.
