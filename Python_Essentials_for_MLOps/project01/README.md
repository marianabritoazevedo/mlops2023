# Project 01 - Building a Movie Recommendation System in Python üçøüé¨üé•

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this Project

The project 01 is a movie recommendation system developed in Python. This portfolio project, avaiable on the [Dataquest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/) platform, focuses on creating a movie recommendation system that finds similar movies based on their titles, and then, constructs a comprehensive recommendation system using movie ratings. The primary objective of this work is to take the original code and apply programming best practices, including code refactoring, clean code principles, exception handling, logging, and unit testing.

## üöÄ How to Run this Project

1. **Setting Up the Environment**

    - Create a folder named `files` inside the directory `project01`.

    - Download the required dataset zip file [here](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip).

    - Unzip the downloaded file and move the `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` files into the `files` folder. These files are essential for running the code.

2. **Running `project1.py`**

    - First, create a virtual environment on your computer:

        ```bash
        python -m venv your_env
        ```

    - Navigate to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file and install the required libraries:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    - Execute the code by running the following command:

        ```bash
        python project1.py
        ```

    - To assess the code quality using `pylint`, run the following command:

        ```bash
        pylint project1.py
        ```

    - For unit testing, use the following command:

        ```bash
        pytest project1.py
        ```

3. **Running `project1_notebook.ipynb`**

    - Open the Jupyter notebook, `project1_notebook.ipynb`, on your local machine or in a tool like Google Colaboratory.

    - Run all the notebook cells to perform necessary installations and interact with the code.
