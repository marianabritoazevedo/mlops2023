As such, three projects were explored, found on the [dataquest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/) platform, with the objective of studying and applying best programming practices in each of them.

### Project 1 - Movie Recommendation System in Python 🎥

**Description:** This project aims to explore the best code practices for MLOps in building a movie recommendation system based on film titles and ratings.

### Project 2 - Airflow Data Pipeline to Download Podcasts 🎧

**Description:** Add description

### Project 3 - Predicting Heart Disease ❤️

**Description:** This project aims to apply the best programming practices in building a KNN classifier for predicting heart diseases.

## ✅ Requirements and technologies

To run any of the three projects mentioned above, you can create a virtual environment and then install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file. For detailed instructions, navigate to the respective folders: `project01`, `project02`, or `project03`, to learn how to set up your environment.

The primary technologies employed in this project, utilizing the Python programming language, included `pylint` for code analysis following best practices, `pytest` for creating unit tests, and many other libraries such as `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn` for executing existing code.
